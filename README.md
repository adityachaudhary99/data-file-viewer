## Usage

Simply click on any supported file in your workspace. The extension will automatically open it in a custom viewer.

## Security Note

⚠️ **Pickle files warning**: Opening `.pkl` and `.joblib` files executes Python code during deserialization. Only open pickle files from trusted sources.

## Requirements

**Python 3.7 or higher** must be installed on your system.

### First-Time Setup

When you first open a data file, the extension will:
1. **Automatically create** its own isolated Python environment
2. **Ask permission** to install required packages (one-time setup)
3. **Install packages** in its own environment (doesn't affect your global Python!)

**That's it!** The setup takes ~2-3 minutes the first time, then works forever.

### Why This Approach?

- ✅ **Isolated**: Doesn't pollute your global Python packages
- ✅ **Persistent**: Packages installed once, work everywhere
- ✅ **Clean**: Uninstall the extension = removes everything
- ✅ **No conflicts**: Won't interfere with your projects

## Extension Settings

Currently, this extension works out of the box with no configuration needed.

## Known Issues

- Very large files (>1GB) may take time to load
- Some custom pickle objects may not serialize to JSON properly

## Release notes are in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)
